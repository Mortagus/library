# library
This repository represent my own tool box containing several classes that represent personal implementations about some general problematics.

The goal here is to centralised my personal work in order to reuse it later.

The implementations are not all based on an uniformed conventions. 
Each file has been developed at different moment and represent the evolution in the way I work since I started to code.

Some classes are not very usefull. Some other are, but not coded properly.

I intend to improve and / or recode some of then.
Feel free to make suggestions and post remarks.
